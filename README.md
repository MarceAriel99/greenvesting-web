This project was developed as part of my frontend learning path. This was my first approach to HTML and CSS.

## What I've learned

- HTML5 file structure, common tags, pages linking and SEO optimization
- CSS3 common properties, box modeling, types of selectors, pseudo-classes, flexbox, grid, responsive design and animations
- Bootstrap integration with CSS3, common components and responsive navbar integration
- SASS nesting, partials, variables and mixins
- File size and type optimization for web

### Some insight into development

- As this is my first project using HTML and CSS I started the development using vanilla HTML5 and CSS3. Then worked my way around integrating Bootstrap and SASS.
- I took a desktop-first approach to make the site responsive as it was the most straightforward way when starting. However, I'm considering using a mobile-first approach for my next project.

## Â¿Why Greenvesting?

When I was starting the project I thought that it would be nice to do the webpage about something exciting to me. Environmentalism and investing are two concepts that I find interesting, and are often seen as incompatible. I think they are not, so I created this fake investing crowdfunding company that accepts small and big investments to be directed to green energy projects.

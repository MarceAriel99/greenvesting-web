This project was developed as part of my frontend learning path. This was my first approach to HTML and CSS.

### Some insigth into development

- As this is my first project using HTML and CSS I started the development using vanilla HTML5 and CSS3. Then worked my way around integrating Bootstrap and SASS.
- I took a desktop-first approach to make the site responsive as it was the most straigthforward way, however I'm considering using a mobile-first approach for my next project.
